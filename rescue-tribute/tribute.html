        <h2 id="program-name">The Victory Program</h2>
        <h3 id="program-slogan">Restoring Lives Together</h3>
        <p>The Victory Program is the Durham Rescue Mission’s 12-month holistic program designed to help people overcome a lifestyle of addictions and return to the workforce investing back into the community.</p>
        <p>Helping others overcome addictions has always been a priority for the ministry of the Durham Rescue Mission. Dr. Ernie Mills’ personal experience with the alcohol addiction of his father led him to Durham in 1973 with a hope of reaching the addicted. Today, the Victory Program helps restore the lives of dozens of men and women throughout the Triangle suffering from alcohol addiction and drug addiction.</p>
